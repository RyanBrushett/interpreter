## Writing an Interpreter in Go

Working through [Writing an Interpreter in Go by Thorsten Ball](https://interpreterbook.com/) to work on my Go, as well as learn a bit about interpreters!

Completed the book on 01/29/2017 and loved it. Highly recommended if you're interested in interpreters, interpreted programming languages, or Go.
